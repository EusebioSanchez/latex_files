	and subsequently shown to be also suitable for shock ignition (Ribeyre
	et al 2009 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion [/0741-3335/51] 51 015013
	). It is shown that the growth of both Richtmyer‚ÄìMeshkov and Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor
	instability (RTI) at the ablation front is reduced by laser pulses
	with an adiabat-shaping picket. An operating window for the parameters
	of the ignition laser spike is described; the threshold power depends
	on beam focusing and synchronization with the compression pulse.
	The time window for spike launch widens with beam power, while the
	minimum spike energy is independent of spike power. A large parametric
	scan indicates good tolerance (at the level of a few percent) to
	target mass and laser power errors. 2D simulations indicate that
	the strong igniting shock wave plays an important role in reducing
	deceleration-phase RTI growth. Instead, the high hot-spot convergence
	ratio (ratio of initial target radius to hot-spot radius at ignition)
	makes ignition highly sensitive to target mispositioning.},

  abstract = {A new version of indirect drive target is proposed for heavy ion inertial
	fusion (HIIF), in which the cavity for radiative symmetrization is
	filled with a low density low Z material and is called a 'hotraum'.
	When heated to a temperature T ?â? 100 eV, the hotraum becomes transparent
	to thermal X-rays and ensures radiative smoothing of the energy flux
	which implodes the fuel capsule enclosed in the cavity. Ion beams
	are focused on the full target cross-section and deposit their energy
	in the high Z casing and in the outer region of the hotraum. The
	initial target configuration is spherical and requires no special
	orientation in the reactor chamber. Enhanced hydrodynamic efficiency
	of the capsule implosion, resulting from tamped ablation inside the
	hotraum, compensates for the high losses in the hotraum and leads
	to a beam-to-fuel energy coupling of about 5% and target gains in
	the range of 50-100. Hydrodynamic mapping of deposition nonuniformities
	onto the fusion capsule can be avoided by fast initial heating of
	the hotraum. A regime is found in which the ablating capsule insulates
	itself from hydrodynamic disturbances in the hotraum. The low density
	required for the hotraum fill allows stopping ranges of up to 100
	mg/cm 2 , corresponding to 6 GeV 209 Bi ions},

  abstract = {A recently introduced method utilizing dimensional continuation is
	employed to compute the energy loss rate for a non-relativistic particle
	moving through a highly ionized plasma. No restriction is made on
	the charge, mass, or speed of this particle. It is, however, assumed
	that the plasma is not strongly coupled in the sense that the dimensionless
	plasma coupling parameter g=e2?D/4?T is small, where ?D is the Debye
	wave number of the plasma. To leading and next-to-leading order in
	this coupling, dE/dx is of the generic form Click to view the MathML
	source. The precise numerical coefficient out in front of the logarithm
	is well known. We compute the constant C under the logarithm exactly
	for arbitrary particle speeds. Our exact results differ from approximations
	given in the literature. The differences are in the range of 20%
	for cases relevant to inertial confinement fusion experiments. The
	same method is also employed to compute the rate of momentum loss
	for a projectile moving in a plasma, and the rate at which two plasmas
	at different temperatures come into thermal equilibrium. Again these
	calculations are done precisely to the order given above. The loss
	rates of energy and momentum uniquely define a Fokker?Planck equation
	that describes particle motion in the plasma. The coefficients determined
	in this way are thus well-defined, contain no arbitrary parameters
	or cutoffs, and are accurate to the order described. This Fokker?Planck
	equation describes the straggling?the spreading in the longitudinal
	position of a group of particles with a common initial velocity and
	position?and the transverse diffusion of a beam of particles. It
	should be emphasized that our work does not involve a model, but
	rather it is a precisely defined evaluation of the leading terms
	in a well-defined perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {We examine the equilibrium properties of hot, non-relativistic plasmas.
	The partition function and density correlation functions of a plasma
	with several species are expressed in terms of a functional integral
	over electrostatic potential distributions. This is a convenient
	formulation for performing a perturbative expansion. The theory is
	made well-defined at every stage by employing dimensional regularization
	which, among other virtues, automatically removes the unphysical
	(infinite) Coulomb self-energy contributions. The leading order,
	field-theoretic tree approximation automatically includes the effects
	of Debye screening. No further partial resummations are needed for
	this effect. Subleading, one-loop corrections are easily evaluated.
	The two-loop corrections, however, have ultraviolet divergences.
	These correspond to the short-distance, logarithmic divergence which
	is encountered in the spatial integral of the Boltzmann exponential
	when it is expanded to third order in the Coulomb potential. Such
	divergences do not appear in the underlying quantum theory - they
	are rendered finite by quantum fluctuations. We show how such divergences
	may be removed and the correct finite theory obtained by introducing
	additional local interactions in the manner of modern effective quantum
	field theories. We compute the two-loop induced coupling by exploiting
	a non-compact su(1, 1) symmetry of the hydrogen atom. This enables
	us to obtain explicit results for density-density correlation functions
	through two-loop order and thermodynamic quantities through three-loop
	order. The induced couplings are shown to obey renormalization group
	equations, and these equations are used to characterize all leading
	logarithmic contributions in the theory. A linear combination of
	pressure plus energy and number densities is shown to be described
	by a field-theoretic anomaly. The effective Lagrangian method that
	we employ yields a simple demonstration that, at long distance, correlation
	functions have an algebraic fall off (because of quantum effects)
	rather than the exponential damping of classical Debye screening.
	We use the effective theory to compute, easily and explicitly, this
	leading long-distance behavior of density correlation functions.
	The presentation is pedagogical and self-contained. The results for
	thermodynamic quantities at three-loop [or O(n5/2)] order, and for
	the leading long-distance forms of correlation functions, agree with
	previous results in the literature, but they are obtained in a novel
	and simple fashion using the effective field theory. In addition
	to the new construction of the effective field theory for plasma
	physics, we believe that the results we report for the explicit form
	of correlation functions at two-loop order, as well as the determination
	of higher-order leading-logarithmic contributions, are also original.},

  journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
  year = {1994},
  volume = {34},
  pages = {1081},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {Converting the kinetic energy of heavy ion beams into radiation energy
	at high efficiency is important for heavy ion fusion. High conversion
	efficiency can be achieved if the radiating material consists mainly
	of a low Z element, for example, beryllium, mixed with a small amount
	of high Z element, for example, lead. For stopping incoming beams
	with a given energy, low Z material has higher stopping power and
	hence has less total internal energy than a high Z material. A high
	Z material is used for efficient radiation; the exact amount used
	is determined by the requirement that the Planck mean free path is
	approximately equal to the dimension of the radiation converter.
	Too much high Z material would hence prevent radiation from escaping
	from the interior region of the radiating material. To reduce the
	hydrodynamic loss in the radial direction, the radiating material
	is placed inside a casing made of high Z material. Calculations show
	that the energy absorbed by the casing is tolerable and that the
	interface between the casing and the radiating material is almost
	stationary. Various scaling laws for the converter are developed.
	Simulations with the LASNEX hydrodynamic code show that carefully
	designed converters can have conversion efficiencies as high as 70%
	(80%) for incoming beams with 10 GeV (5 GeV) energy. Because the
	converters have high efficiency and ion range shortening in beryllium
	is not substantial, range shortening is not a major issue. Once the
	diagram for the conversion efficiency versus the converter radius
	is obtained for various beam ion energies, the trajectory is located
	on this diagram that gives the upper limit for conversion efficiency
	(and hence for gain) while satisfying the engineering limit of the
	quadrupole pole-tip magnetic fields of the final-focusing system
	for heavy ion beams (for ballistic transport through a hard-vacuum
	reactor chamber). Finally, converter configurations are presented
	that can deflect the direction of radiation, thereby eliminating
	the need for ion beam bending},

	An example result shows an 84% reduction of the R-T instability growth.
	In the analytical work two stratified inviscid fluids are treated

	shows that the R-T instability growth rate does not change from the

	strongly affected and mitigated by the oscillating acceleration;
	The transverse velocity of w is derived at the interface of the two

	to release sufficient fusion energy in a robust manner. On the other
	hand, the HIB illumination non-uniformity depends strongly on a target
	displacement dz from the centre of a fusion reactor chamber. In a
	direct-driven implosion mode, dz of ~ 20 ?ºm was tolerable, and in
	an indirect-implosion mode, dz of ~ 100 ?ºm was allowable. In the
	direct-indirect mixture mode target, a low-density foam layer is
	inserted, and the radiation energy is confined in the foam layer.
	In the foam layer the radiation transport is expected to smooth the
	HIB illumination non-uniformity in the lateral direction. Two-dimensional
	implosion simulations are performed, and show that the HIB illumination
	non-uniformity is well smoothed in the direct-indirect hybrid-mode

	for modeling laser/target effects including debris/shrapnel generation.
	The code combines Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) hydrodynamics
	with Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) to connect the continuum to microstructural
	regimes. The code is unique in its ability to model hot radiating
	plasmas and cold fragmenting solids. New numerical techniques were
	developed for many of the physics packages to work efficiency on
	a dynamically moving and adapting mesh. A flexible strength/failure
	framework allows for pluggable material models. Material history
	arrays are used to store persistent data required by the material
	models, for instance, the level of accumulated damage or the evolving
	yield stress in J2 plasticity models. We model ductile metals as
	well as brittle materials such as Si, Be, and B4C. We use interface
	reconstruction based on volume fractions of the material components
	within mixed zones and reconstruct interfaces as needed. This interface
	reconstruction model is also used for void coalescence and fragmentation.
	The AMR framework allows for hierarchical material modeling (HMM)
	with different material models at different levels of refinement.
	Laser rays are propagated through a virtual composite mesh consisting
	of the finest resolution representation of the modeled space. A new
	2nd order accurate diffusion solver has been implemented for the
	thermal conduction and radiation transport packages. The code is
	validated using laser and x-ray driven spall experiments in the US
	and France. We present an overview of the code and simulation results.},

	different particle energies are presented. Low-energy ions of moderate
	power are used to directly drive a spherical-shell target that is
	cryogenically layered with a deuterium-tritium (DT) mixture. The
	purpose of this first pulse is to compress the DT fuel and tamper;
	compressions of a hundred to a few hundred times solid density appear
	possible. Following compression the target is irradiated with a high-particle
	energy and high-power pulse. The main purpose of the second pulse
	is to bring the central DT region to ignition. Additional compression
	of no more than 10 is needed. For targets with a low-Z pusher, gains
	greater than a hundred are possible with an ignition pulse of 1000
	TW and a heavy-ion particle energy of 40 GeV. Pulse requirements,
	finite focusing effects, and symmetry requirements are discussed.},

	utilize the energy efficiency of direct drive while optimizing on
	the symmetry requirements. Heavy-ion beams of charge state Z 10 GeV
	have 15&#8211;20 m bending radii with 3.5-T fields. Beams like these
	could be used with targets involving direct drive. Control of asymmetries
	in direct-drive ion beam targets depends on control of the effects
	of residual target asymmetries after an appropriate illumination
	scheme has been adopted. In this paper, we outline results of our
	investigations into ion beam target concepts in which the effects
	of residual asymmetries are ameliorated. The beams are placed according
	to our axially symmetric Gaussian-quadrature illumination scheme
	(Mark 1986). The targets survive the effects of residual asymmetries
	in our recent 2-D hydrodynamic simulations. We also briefly discuss
	the additional positive effects of polarized DT fuel on ion beam
	targets. },

	description of the stagnation phase in which the shell is considered
	to stagnate isentropically except in a central region of the fuel
	where the ignition profiles are determined by the competition of
	the energy losses due to thermal conduction and radiation with the
	heating due to compressional work and alpha particle deposition of
	energy. As a result, the temperature and the confinement parameter
	of the central spark are found to be dependent on the implosion velocity
	upsilon 0 , and the ignition conditions are obtained consistently
	with the implosion dynamics. In addition, the minimum energy of the
	beam E B ign required for ignition is calculated and the scaling
	E B ign varies as upsilon 0 -5 is found, which is in good agreement
	with previously reported simulations},

	The target has cylindrical symmetry with disk endplates. The ions
	uniformly illuminate these endplates in a 5?mm radius spot. We discuss
	the considerations which led to this design together with some previously
	unused design features: low-density hohlraum walls in approximate
	pressure balance with internal low-Z fill materials, radiation symmetry
	determined by the position of the radiator materials and particle
	ranges, and early time pressure symmetry possibly influenced by radiation
	shims. We discuss how this target scales to lower input energy or
	to lower beam power. Variant designs with more realistic beam focusing
	strategies are also discussed. We show the tradeoffs required for
	targets which accept higher particle energies. Finally, the impact
	of the fast ignitor concept on heavy ion fusion is discussed.},

	analysis of directly driven targets are presented. These include
	theoretical, computational and applied physical studies and developments
	of detailed simulation models for the most relevant processes in
	ICF. The simulation of directly driven ICF targets is carried out
	with the one-dimensional NORCLA code developed at DENIM. This code
	contains two main segments: NORMA and CLARA, able to work fully coupled
	and in an iterative manner. NORMA solves the hydrodynamic equations
	in a lagrangian mesh. It has modular programs coupled to it to treat
	the laser or particle beam interaction with matter. Equations of
	state, opacities and conductivities are taken from a DENIM atomic
	data library, generated externally with other codes that will also
	be explained in this work. CLARA solves the transport equation for
	neutrons, (Boltzmann), as well as for charged particles, and suprathermal
	electrons (Fokker-Planck), using discrete ordinates and finite element
	methods in the computational procedure. Parametric calculations of
	multilayered single-shell targets driven by heavy ion beams are also
	analyzed. Finally, conclusions are focused on the ongoing developments
	in the areas of interest such as: radiation transport, atomic physics,
	particle in cell method, charged particle transport, two-dimensional
	calculations and instabilities. },
