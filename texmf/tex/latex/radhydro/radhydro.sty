%%% PAGE SIZE OPTIONS %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% DEFAULT OPTIONS, 1 INCH MARGINS %%%
% Set the stock size:
%   This is the size of the paper that goes in the printer.
\setstocksize{11in}{8.5in}

% Set the trimmed size: 
%   This is the size that the paper from the printer is cut to for publication. 
%   Since we don't cut the paper this is the same as the stock size.
\settrimmedsize{11in}{8.5in}{*}

% Set the type block size:
%   This is the width of the text on the page. So the text block size plus the
%   margins forms the trimmed size. Below, I'm setting up the page for one inch
%   margins.
\settypeblocksize{9in}{6.5in}{*}

% Set the left/right margins:
%   Once you set the left margin, the right is automatically computed using the
%   type block size.
\setlrmargins{1.0in}{*}{*}

% Set the upper/lower margins:
%  Once you set the upper margin, the bottom is automatically computed using the
%  type block size.
\setulmargins{1.0in}{*}{*}

% The following command takes all of the options that were provided
% about the page and sets all of the other options so that everything
% is consistent.
